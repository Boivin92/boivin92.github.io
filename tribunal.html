					Attuning to Orovei creates a Tie of Upholding Justice in its wielder, which starts at Minor and grows one step after each story. This intimacy can be eroded but can never be destroyed as long as the wielder is attuned to Orovei. Against undead creatures, Orovei can make a special  Decisive attack which follow these special rules: 
				<ul>
				<li>Hitting does not reset Initiative to base value</li>
<li>The attack ignores Hardness</li>
<li>The base damage of the attack is equal to the strength of [Tie of Justice + Essence]</li>
<li>Each point of damage dealt by this attack removes a point of temporary Willpower from the undead creature rather than damaging the health track</li>
<li>If this attack brings the undead to 0 willpower, it gains a Major Tie of Submission towards the wielder of Orovei</li>

				</ul>

					This charm is a special gambit which can only target undead creatures with a tie of Submission towards the wielder of Orovei.

				<strong>Soul-Servitude Sentence (Difficulty [Target’s Essence]):</strong> If successful, the wielder of Orovei can bind the undead to a task in the same way a sorcerer can bind a demon (as per the Summon First Circle Demon spell). The undead will be binded to the task for as long as it takes to complete it, or for a year and a day, whichever comes first. Once bound, shackles of Obsidian appear upon the slave’s wrists (or other appropriate place if it has no wrists) until the task is over.
