				Orovei, The Eternal Tribunal (Artifact Goremaul ••• )
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>
				The Eternal Tribunal was forged recently within the confines of the Underworld. The Vulture Who Preyed On His Own Flesh, a Moonshadow Abyssal,
        crafted this weapon from 71 restless souls arguing against the rulership of the Deathlords. Vulture spent 71 days trying to calm the shades
        and make them understand the magnanimity of their Liege and understanding the intentions, motivations and history of each individual ghost
        threatening the peace of death. On the 72nd day, he captured them all within a net of braided tears and condemned each one individually
        to serve the Underworld for all eternity.
        <br><br>
        He smelt each of them with earth from their graves and forged them while enumerating their crimes against both the deads and the livings.
        Days later, Vulture brought Orovei to his Liege, which was pleased by the artifact and asked that it be stored and forgotten as a last punishment
        to those souls who dared defy him. Vulture refused, saying that he had already declared judgment on them. Vulture refused, and left to find a
        wielder for Orovei.
        <br><br>
        Searching far and wide across the Underworld, he caught wind of an undead-huntress travelling Creation, and tracked her. Vulture found the huntress
        in a Shadowland and gave her the Eternal Tribunal, ordering her to use this wonder against the corrupted souls fleeing the realms of death
        or mortals witholding offerings to their ancestors.

					Evocations of Orovei
				</dt>
				<dd>
					Attuning to Orovei creates a Tie of Upholding Justice in its wielder, which starts at Minor and grows one step after each story.
          This intimacy can be eroded but can never be destroyed as long as the wielder is attuned to Orovei.
          Against undead creatures, Orovei can make a special Decisive attack which follow these special rules:
				<ul>
				<li>Hitting does not reset Initiative to base value</li>
<li>The attack ignores Hardness</li>
<li>The base damage of the attack is equal to [Tie of Justice + Essence]</li>
<li>Each point of damage dealt by this attack removes a point of temporary Willpower from the undead creature rather than damaging the health track</li>
<li>If this attack brings the undead to 0 willpower, it gains a Major Tie of Submission towards the wielder of Orovei</li>
<li>This attack has no effect on the Abyssals or Liminals, as neither are truly undead.</li>
				</ul>

				<strong>Soul-Servitude Sentence (Difficulty [Target’s Essence]):</strong>
        If successful, the wielder of Orovei can bind the undead to a task in the same way a sorcerer can bind a demon
        (as per the Summon First Circle Demon spell). The undead will be bound to the task for as long as it takes to complete it,
        or for a year and a day, whichever comes first. Once bound, shackles of obsidian appear upon the slave’s wrists
        (or other appropriate place if it has no wrists) until the task is over.
