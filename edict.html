				Divine Edict (Thaumaturgic Ritual - â€¢)
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>
			Gifted people are sometimes born with the capacity to project their voice beyond the limitations of mortals.
      The thaumaturge must have at least two of his senses numbed except his hearing in order to activate this gift.
      Traditionally, thaumaturges would use a blindfold and a thick salt paste to numb their sight and taste,
      but others use drugs to numb their touch. Mystics rarely choose to numb their smell by pinching their nose,
      due to the high pitch they have while doing so.
      <br>
			<br>
      Gathering his voice and allowing it to echo within his own body, the thaumaturge may unleash a message of
      ten words or less with such power that it can be heard clearly at up to Extreme range, or across the whole city.
      Using this gift costs a point of Willpower and mutes the gifted until the scene ends.
			<br>

			Before the Empress disappeared, a Magistrate of the Realm was using this gift to tell his final judgement,
      using his subsequent silence as a way to avoid having to explain himself to the population.
