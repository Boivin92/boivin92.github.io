				Incenser of Mela - Artifact ••
			</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				This artifact is made of blue jade, with a chain of orichalcum holding it. It is the size of a grapefruit and is engraved with imageries of Mela chasing demons into cleansing flames.
        When incense is lit within it, little to no smoke comes out when compared to a regular incenser, but an Exalt may blow on it
        while spending 5 motes of essence in order to fill the room with a thick white cloud. The cloud fills the room in which the Exalt
        is standing (if inside one) or up to Medium range if outside. Any immaterial creature within that range is outlined by the smoke
        and can be attacked by material creatures, but unless they materialize, the spirit cannot interact with the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immaterial spirits caught in the cloud can be discerned without a check at up to short range. Any check made to attack or spot beings or objects beyond
        short range suffer a -2 visibility penalty. Note that immaterial spirits can still attempt Stealth, but suffer all the normal penalties for being
        physical. Smoke stays for the scene if inside a room or other closed environment, but will dissipate in a minute or so if outside.
        Soft winds move the cloud one range band each turn, while strong winds dissipate the cloud after a single round.
