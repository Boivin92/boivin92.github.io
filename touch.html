				Touch of Life (Thaumaturgic Ritual ••)
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>
			
			The Touch of Life is an enlightening of the soul and the chakras of the body. It necessitates rigorous meditation and deep understanding of one's being to be unlocked by a student, but one born with this gift has been seen walking the South a hundred years ago - marked by the gift of life, it is rumored that his blood could even cure diseases.
			<br>
			<br>
			Plants you touch become ripe for gathering or consumption within a minute or two. This ritual works on plants, fruits and vegetables even after harvesting. The larger the plant, the longer it takes for your touch to work. A minute or so for an apple, maybe an hour for an apple tree.			
			<br>
			<br>
			Using this ritual on a plant which should not be fruitful during this time (during a drought or winter, for example) takes a point of willpower and brings it back to a healthy state. 

			<br>
			<br>
			This power can never be turned off, but the user is not forced to pay the willpower cost when touching weak plants or fruits.
