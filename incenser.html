				Incenser of Mela - Artifact ••
			</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				This artifact is made of blue jade, with a chain of orichalcum holding it. It has the size of a grapefruit and is engraved with imageries of Mela chasing demons into cleansing flames. When incense is lit within it, little to no smoke comes out when compared to a regular incenser, but an Exalt may blow on it while spending 5 motes of essence in order to fill the room with a thick white cloud. The cloud fills the room in which the Exalt is standing (if inside one) or up to Medium range if outside. Any immaterial creature within that range is outlined by the smoke and can be attacked by material creatures, but unless they materialize, the spirit cannot interact with the physical world. The cloud imposes a -2 visibility penalty on everyone inside it when interacting with objects or people further than Close range with each other.
