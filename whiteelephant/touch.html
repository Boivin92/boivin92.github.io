				Touch of Life (Thaumaturgic Ritual ••)
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>

			The Touch of Life is an enlightening of the soul and the chakras of the body.
      It necessitates rigorous meditation and deep understanding of one's being to be
      unlocked by a student. Being born with this gift is rare but not unheard of. About a hundred
      years ago, one such mystic walked the north, leaving fresh green grass in his footsteps even during winter.
			<br>
			<br>
      The mystic can touch a plant and murmur a prayer of growth, focusing on the essence
      of life flowing from him into the recipient. The larger the plant or fruit, the longer
      the prayer must be - a minute or so for an apple, an hour or so for an apple tree. The plant will gather life for as long as the prayer continues, with fruits becoming fresher while plants and trees bloom or gain in colors.
      After the prayer has been done, the mystic rolls (Stamina+Survival) at a difficulty 2. Success means the essence of life stays in the plant, failure removes all life from it - an apple might turn to ashes, while a tree will turn grey and its leaves fall within the day.
			<br>
			<br>
			Using this ritual on a plant which should not be fruitful during this time
      (during a drought or winter, for example) takes a point of willpower and brings
      it back to a healthy state.
