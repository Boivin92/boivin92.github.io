				Water Walk (Thaumaturgic Ritual - â€¢)
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>

			The mystic removes any footwear and starts singing a mudra of lost words while throwing handfuls of flowers in a body of water. This ritual takes 5 minutes and requires the thaumaturge to have access to a good number of flowers. At the end of the ritual, the mystic claps his hands together, and as long as he keeps them together, he can walk on water as if it was solid. Grappling the Thaumaturge breaks his hand posture and thus the ritual.
			<br>
			<br>
			This ritual was last seen only a few years ago near the Dreaming Sea, where the thaumaturge exiled himself to walk the Sea endlessly rather than facing trial for murder. The rumors say he nailed his hands together before leaving, so that he could sleep on the sea itself.
