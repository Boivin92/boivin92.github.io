				Kuai-Huo’s Comprehensive Atlas (Ambition 1 Solar Working)
			</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				Kuai-Huo is a moderately-sized village in the East housing about 2000 souls. Governing Kuai-Huo is the sorcerer Silver Marrow Dreams, living in a local Demesne.
			<br>
			<br>
			A few years ago, Dreams completed his lifelong goal of creating the Comprehensive Atlas of his city. The Atlas is an enormous book, with each page as tall as a man and as large as a wolf, bound in the bark of greenmaws and written with ink laced of starmetal. The Atlas describes with precision the whole region surrounding Kuai-Huo and its text changes with the passage of time or the workings of man.

			<br>
			<br>
			If changes are made to the Atlas by using the appropriate ink (or by destroying passages or whole pages) the changes are also made to the real place described in the Atlas. Destroying the Atlas would turn the whole state into a barren wasteland.

			<br>
			<br>
			Correcting or changing anything in the Atlas is a (Intelligence+Linguistics) check at difficulty 3 to 5, depending on the change. Failure will cause minor problems or unforeseen events to occur (such as a newly created waterfall which falls upwards, or a bridge without a deck, or a wheat field growing on hard rocks). Changes include changing the climate, adding features, moving features around, and many others. Note that the Atlas only describes the state of Kuai-Huo and thus its power cannot go beyond its borders.
			<br>
			<br>
			Destroying a page is a feat of strength 3 with a difficulty of 3. Doing so has terrible consequences upon the landscape of Kuai-Huo and could destroy houses, farms, remove rivers, etc…
			<br>
			<br>
			Due to a mishap during the Atlas’s creation, once per story, it gathers the rumors or stories of those living within Kuai-Huo and changes some features according to one of those stories. A dense forest might slowly become completely lightless, a swamp might bubble toxic fumes or a high cliff might become literally a mile high.
