				Kezu, the Crystal Dojo
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>
        In a southern canyon, where the sun rarely shines, stands a twisted building of dried wood and purple crystals.
        A testament of the last century, Kezu the Crystal Dojo stands proud against wind, sand and time.
  <br><br>
  Long ago, Kezu was the rash master of a dojo of monks, who sought to govern the local spirits through his martial prowess.
  As a punishment for his arrogance, elementals stormed the dojo, killed the monks and captured him. They tortured Kezu for days,
  feeding him a paste of sand and alchemical fluids. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. After too long for him to understand,
  his mind broke and he fell into madness; it was then that the elementals completed their punishment and started humming together a song
  from the depths of earth, which turned the blood, flesh and bones of the proud master into crystals of a deep purple color with no shape near human.
  <br><br>
  Years passed, and the crystals grew, slowly encrusting the walls, ceiling and pillars of the dojo - the master was now a part of his temple.
  The crystals are starting to protrude from the outside walls, but haven't been able to push their boundaries more than a few yards beyond the building.
  <br><br>
  Nowadays, people simply stay away from Kezu. A few souls sometimes wander near it, and they say they could hear strange voices
  from the crystals themselves, as if it beckoned them to step into the building. Some did, but no one came outâ€¦ except one woman.
  She was thought dead for a year, but when she returned, her eyes were rough spheres of pink crystals and she started teaching an occult martial-art
  to those willing to learn.
