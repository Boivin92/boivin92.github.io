				Kezu, the Crystal Dojo
			</h3>
		</div>
			<p>
      Somewhere in a southern canyon stands the pagoda known as Kezu. An ancient dojo built a few decades ago, it now stands in the sand, frame fused to
      huge outcrops of purple crystals. The pagoda was a dojo of the Immaculate Styles upon its construction, but a proud shikari decided to try and
      blackmail the local Stone Elemental Court, leading to a savage attack from them. The Elementals invoked their common power and forced a giant crystal
      out from the ground, forcing the monks outside where they faced against the elementals in a bloody battle.
			<br>
			<br>
      Nowaday, Kezu is considered to be a cautionary tale amongst Immaculate Monks travelling to Gem. Many pilgrims take a detour from their road
      to go commune with this fusion of civilization and elemental ferocity. Some brave monks enter the dojo, searching for scrolls or tomes about the
      Immaculate Styles. The place is also raided by fortune seekers wanting to grab as many crystals as possible. Sadly for most of them, the Dojo
      is currently the nest of a small group of territorial Gem Crabs.
      <br>
      <br>
      Rumors say that the central crystal, piercing three floors of the pagoda, holds a dark secret - the elementals, winners of the fight a few decades
      ago, would have captured the soul of the Shikari who dared insult them.
